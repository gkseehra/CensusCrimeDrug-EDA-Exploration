# CensusCrimeDrug-EDA-Exploration

## Overview
CensusCrimeDrug-EDA-Exploration is a comprehensive repository where I perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on three distinct datasets: Census Income Data, Crime Data, and Drug Consumption Data. This project aims to uncover insights and patterns within these datasets, showcasing the power of data analysis in understanding societal trends.

## Datasets
1. **Census Income Data**: This dataset includes information about the demographics and income levels of various populations.
2. **Crime Data**: A comprehensive collection of crime statistics across different regions.
3. **Drug Consumption Data**: Detailed data on drug consumption patterns among different demographics.

## Objectives
- To perform detailed exploratory data analysis on each dataset.
- To identify key trends and patterns within the data.
- To use visualizations to effectively communicate findings.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, numpy, folium, sklearn.

## Structure of the Repository
- `EDA-Income-Crime-Drug_Data.ipynb`: Notebook containing EDA on all three datase
